# Briefly introduction
The project aiming to give an example for the fresh man of python leaners.

Some basic operation may used in the jupyter page. And at the end of the project, we'll try something interesting which is called data analyse.

> tip: the book for this course is written by my professor, and the lecture process maybe a useful way to make you learn more about python.

So! Have a good time here.

In 23 May I have finished a lot about the homework of the course, and the pandas is the most useful module I felt which can help me do some query and udpate to the form.

This is a git push test.
